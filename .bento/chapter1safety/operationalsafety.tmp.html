<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The machine will be supplied as a complete machine. After commissioning, the responsibility for the safety of the machine is transferred from the manufacturer to the user. The user can produce goods with the machine as intended.</p>

<p>Significant changes</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The machine has been significantly changed if a new hazard is posed by this change, which results in an increase in an existing risk or to a new risk which cannot be eliminated or reduced with simple guards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simple guards in the context include guards which are integrated in the safety circuit of the machine via signal exchange, or which shut down or shield dangerous machine functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The machine can be optionally equipped with signal and safety interfaces ex works, which make it possible for the user or an integrator to add components to the machine, e.g. a robot or fixture or to integrate the machine in a superordinate system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user or integrator is responsible for the safety of the altered machine:</p>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Integration may only be performed by qualified personnel</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Connection of components to the interfaces must be performed according to the specification set out by JFY.</pre>

<p>If the user or integrator has made a significant change to the machine, they become the manufacturer of the altered machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user or integrator must carry out an evaluation process(e.g.,conformity assessment) for the altered machine in accordance with national regulations(e.g.,the EU Machinery Directive) of the country in which the machine is operated. He, as the manufacturer, is responsible for the safety of the significantly changed machine.</p>
