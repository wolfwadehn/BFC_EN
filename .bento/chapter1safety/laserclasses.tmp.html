<div class="paragraph">
<p>Laser products are divided into laser classes as per the international standard IEC 60825-1(USA: ANSI Z136.1, ANSI B11.21). The laser class corresponds to the hazard level of the laser light emitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The machine is a class 1 laser product. When all guards are active, the accessible laser radiation from all beam sources installed is not dangerous under reasonably foreseeable conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All beam sources which the personnel can come into contact with are listed below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The section "Danger due to laser radiation" describes the situations in which personnel may come into contact with a laser source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, other beam sources can be installed which emit laser radiation (e.g., laser light barriers for component and container query). However, the personnel are not exposed to this radiation at any time during operation of the machine or during setting and maintenance work.</p>
