<h2 id="_1_2_machine_frame">1.2 Machine frame</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The machine frame is designed as a welded steel construction. Internal stress of the machine is eliminated by the vibration stress relief process. As a result of precise machining, the machine frame offers a horizontal and stable platform for the motion unit .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, the machine is designed with part removal plates to guide the scraps the slags from cutting all the way into the slag cart underneath the machine body. Due to the intense heat and strong adhesion of the slags, the part removal plates need to be cleaned weekly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On each side of the machine body, a high-precision linear ball bearing guide rail is installed along Y axis. This ensures the movement accuracy of the crossbeam on Y-axis direction. A high-precision rack is installed next to the guide rail on both sides. The rack engages with the pinion to move the crossbeam on Y-axis direction. The high-precision linear ball bearing guide rail and the rack are lubricated by central lubrication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The linear guide rails are covered with flexible bellow-style protective covers. Use the protective covers correctly so that they can slide smoothly. Do not press the protective covers. Otherwise, the protective covers may get deformed or damaged. Please take proper care of the protective covers. This helps to keep dust away from the racks and guide rails, extend their service life and maintain the transmission accuracy of the machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the protection of system software limits and electrical switches, the motion unit of the crossbeam is clad with polyurethane for collision protection.</p>

<h2 id="_1_3_crossbeam">1.3 Crossbeam</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Crossbeam is connected to the linear guide rails on the Y-axis direction. This closed gantry structure with dual drives features a high rigidity and lightweight construction, which makes it easy to achieve high speed and dynamics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The crossbeam movement is driven by the servo motors and transmitted by the rack and pinion systems on two sides. This enables fast positioning. quicker response and thus better dynamics of the crossbeam. In addition, two high-precision linear ball bearing guide rails are mounted on the crossbeam and connected to the motion components of X axis. X-axis rack is installed on the crossbeam and engages with the pinion of the Z-axis servo components. High-precision linear ball bearing guide rail and rack are lubricated by central lubrication and covered by the flexible protective covers. Use the protective covers correctly so that they can slide smoothly. Do not press the protective covers. Otherwise, the protective covers may get deformed or damaged. Please take proper care of the protective covers. This helps to keep dust away from the high precision racks and guide rails, extend their service life and maintain the transmission accuracy of the machine.</p>

<h2 id="_1_4_servo_system">1.4 Servo system</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most components of the servo system are made of aluminum alloy, which significantly reduces its weight. This is beneficial to the movement of servo system along the laser beam transmission direction, reducing the inertial force when starting or stopping the servo system and ensuring the transmission quality of the light path. In addition, the servo slide is connected to the guide carriages to ensure precise guiding. Movement of the servo components on X-axis direction is driven by the automatic digital servo motor and transmitted by the rack and pinion system to ensure precise movement. Z-axis movement is driven by automatic digital servo motor and transmitted by coupling and ball screw. Cutting head is mounted on the Z-axis servo slide.</p>

<h2 id="_1_5_pallet_changer">1.5 Pallet changer</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pallet changer consists of two identical pallets with toothed slats. During production, one pallet is moved to the machining position inside the machine. The other pallet is moved to the loading and unloading position outside the machine. Positions of the two pallets can be exchanged. For optimized processing time, the pallet can be loaded and unloaded while machining. As a result, the downtime for loading and unloading in the past is saved now and the productivity is improved. In particular, loading and unloading of thicker or larger sheet require longer time, which now can be saved due to loading and unloading parallel to production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The frame of the pallet changer is constructed by welding together special-shaped steel tubes, which gives the frame a high rigidity. The pallet is designed with a grid frame which is supported by sheet metals and used as a worktable for the workpieces to be processed. Toothed slats are mounted on the grid frame and can be removed and replaced conveniently if ablation occurs to the teeth. In addition, the toothed slats can be cut using the laser cutting machine. This makes maintenance of the machine easier. Use of new tooth slats also reduce abrasion and scratch on the sheet to be processed, lower the spatter and improve the cutting result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the pallet change process, the pallet is pulled by the chain and guided by the guide rail. In addition, the toothed slats installed on the pallet can be exchange easily and quickly.</p>

<h2 id="_1_6_suction_system">1.6 Suction system</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During laser cutting of the sheet, a certain amount of dust will be generated. If dust-extraction measures are not taken, the cutting result and the workshop environment will be affected. For this reason, the machine is equipped with a suction system mainly consisting of the blower and pipes. The main pipe of the suction system is installed inside the machine body and connect to the blower via pipe.</p>

<h2 id="_1_7_slag_removal_system">1.7 Slag removal system</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the laser cutting process, a large amount of scraps and slags will be generated. These scraps and slags will be guided by the part removal plates into the slag cart underneath the machine body. Each slag cart has four casters which make it easy to push, pull and drag around. The handle of the slag cart can be rotated upward or downward and disconnected from the slag cart. The slag cart is positioned below the part removal plates. When the scarps and slags pile up, the slag cart can be pulled out from side of the machine. After emptying, push the slag cart along the guide plate underneath the machine to the designated position until next emptying.</p>
