<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lubrication is primarily targeted for the transmission part of the machine. Z-axis guide rail and ball screw are lubricated by self-lubrication mechanism. The pinion and rack systems should be lubricated by central lubrication once a week, the grease type is 0# extreme pressure lithium base grease. The chain of the machine should be lubricated with grease once a month by people, the grease type is 46# grease.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The chain of the machine should be inspected every 6 months. Re-tighten the chain if it’s found to be loose. Tightening procedures: Loosen the screws on the installation plate of the chain wheel. Adjust the chain wheel to a proper position with the adjustment screw of the chain wheel. Tighten the nuts on the installation plate of the chain wheel after adjustment.</p>

<p>Make sure that the distilled water is used for cooling water of the process chillers. Otherwise, the service life of the laser device and lens will be affected. Replace the water every two months. Otherwise, the flow rate will be affected by the change in water quality. Outlet pressure of the cooling water should be set to 0.4Mpa ~ 0.5Mpa. Cooling water temperature of the external light path is normally set to 28℃. Cooling water temperature of the laser device is normally set to 26℃ (in winter) and 26℃ (in summer). Fluctuation range of the water temperature is ±1℃. In case of a high cooling water temperature in the external light path, setting temperature of cooling water should be increased appropriately to prevent condensation on the lens, which will affect the service life of the lens.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the large amount of metal dust generated during laser processing, it’s recommended to remove the dust in the electrical cabinet of the laser cutting machine regularly (once a month).The working condition of cooling fan should also be checked to avoid problems caused by dust buildup such as overheating, short circuit, malfunction and premature failure of the components etc.</p>
</div>
