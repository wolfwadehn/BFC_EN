<p>1. Lens contamination is divided into two categories. The first category is contamination caused by dust or spatter. In this situation, black scorched spots can be seen on the lens. Contamination of spatter typically causes greyish or light yellowish scorched spot surrounded by white or yellow halos. Contamination of dust often causes tiny black scorched spots. The second category is contamination caused by condensate or fume, which will result in a wide area of discoloration in ring shape. Generally, contamination of condensate (water or steam) is presented as a white ring and contamination of cutting fume is presented as a yellow ring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2. Contamination caused by dust or slags are mostly seen on the upper side of the collimation lens, focusing lens and protective galss as well as the lower side of the protective glass. Except that the contamination on the lower side of the protective glass is caused by spatter during normal cutting process, contamination on the other positions can be avoided by improved operation during maintenance. Contamination on the upper side of the collimation lens is typically caused by dust or slags falling from the connection point of QBH connector and LLK due to design tolerance. Tape or protective film can be used for sealing at this position.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contamination above the focusing lens is easy to deal with and is generally caused by incorrect operation when removing and installing the focusing lens drawer. Contamination in this case is usually caused by particles rather than fumes. The particles will eventually fall down after floating while the fumes float upwards. Therefore, the upper surface of the lens is not contaminated during removal and installation of the focusing lens drawer. However, it must be noted that the gas supply should be cut off (including cutting gas, assist gas and cooling gas) for a few minutes before removing all the focusing lens drawers. In addition, the cutting head must be lifted up from the sheet to reduce the risk of spatter contamination as much as possible. At the same time, the cutting head chamber must be sealed with another clean drawer or a special white cover from JFY to minimize the risk of the dust entering the chamber. In principle, the end-users are not authorized to remove and install the focusing lens drawer since they often fail to pay attention to the dust-free requirements of the fiber laser. It’s recommended that the focusing lens drawer should only be replaced by your equipment maintenance technicians and sealed with a sticker. This prevents the case of the end-user opening the light path and damaging the lens or laser cable when it’s unknown to JFY and you. Additionally, we can not guarantee that a complete dust-free condition is met during the removal and installation of the focusing lens drawer in an exposed environment. Theoretically, after three rounds of removal and installation of the focusing lens drawer, the maintenance work must be carried out for the complete cutting head within half a month, which means the complete cutting head must be removed and placed on a clean worktable or in a clean room for the cleaning and maintenance.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Handling of the protective glass to prevent contamination is similar to the handling of the focusing lens mentioned above. The contamination is usually caused by particles instead of fumes. Things to pay attentions to are similar to the case of the focusing lens drawer, which include: the gas supply should be cut off (including cutting gas, assist gas and cooling gas) for a few minutes before removing all the protective glass drawers. In addition, the cutting head must be lifted up from the sheet to reduce the risk of spatter contamination as much as possible. The only thing different is, if the nozzle is covered with the tape and the protective glass drawer is only removed or installed after a period of waiting of 1-2 minutes, the contamination prevention result will be better. If the removal and installation of the protective lens drawer is performed correctly, no additional maintenance of the cutting unit is required. Unless the procedures for replacement above are not followed, otherwise the dust will not enter into the focus lens module.</p>

<p>3. Sealing ring: Sealing ring play a critical role in all operations of the welding cutting head. It’s used for sealing at every connection between the modules of our products. If the sealing ring is deformed or damaged as shown in the picture, it must be replaced with a new one. Otherwise, sealing problems and cutting head contamination will definitely occur. Generally, a performance test of the sealing ring is included in the cleaning and maintenance procedures for the complete cutting head. It’s recommended that the performance test of the sealing ring should be carried out every three months.</p>

<p>4. Regarding the condensation issue in summer and winter season as i mentioned in the email earlier, the details are described as below:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the approach of the winter season, temperatures across the country has begun to drop significantly. Currently, the end-users are reporting cases of burnt collimation lens due to condensation in the cutting head. Please remind the customers to make preparations in advance to avoid this issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conditions and characteristics of burnt collimation lens due to condensation are listed below:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>As the winter season approaches, ambient temperature where most end-users are based is below 10℃. More importantly, the cutting head is installed vertically and parallel to the process cooler for cooling by many integrators. The minimum temperature setting of the process cooler is around 15℃. Therefore, cooling water condensation is easy to occur (temperature of cooling water is 10℃ or higher above the room temperature). The condensed water will flow down along the fiber/cutting head, eventually drop onto the collimation lens and lead to a burnt collimation lens.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2. In another possible case, the collimation lens is maintained at a relatively high temperature due to cooling water with relatively high temperature. When the temperature of the collimation lens is 10℃ or higher above the room temperature and contacts with free air, condensed vapor is likely to form, resulting in a burnt collimation lens when the laser beam is ignited. This situation happens very frequently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>3. For collimation lens which are burnt due to condensed water droplets, a clearly visible large white spot can be seen on the lens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>4. If the above problems exit, condensed water can be seen or felt by hand on the outside of cutting head/cooling water pipe/laser light cable. Therefore, it’s advised that the integrator should confirm with different end-users regarding their ambient temperatures and adjust the cooling water temperature settings accordingly. In addition, if the machine is switched on after a long downtime, make sure that the end-users check the outer surface of the laser light cable/ cutting head and only ignite the beam when there is no condensation present. In case of condensation, please check and clean the lens immediately to avoid time and financial losses due to burnt colliamtion lens.</p>
