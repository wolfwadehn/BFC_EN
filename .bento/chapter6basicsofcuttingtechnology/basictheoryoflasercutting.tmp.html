<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Laser cutting refers to the thermal cutting method that separates material by using focused laser beam with high power density to melt, vaporize, ablate and ignite the workpiece material, and blowing away the molten material with high speed gas flow running co-axially with the laser beam.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the different thermal-physical manifestations of cutting materials and assist gases, laser cutting can be roughly divided into:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_laser_fusion_cutting">Laser fusion cutting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During fusion cutting process, the workpiece metal is heated and molten, causing the material change from solid to liquid, and blown out by the high-pressure inert gas (typically nitrogen).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The speed of laser cutting is basically proportional to the laser power of the machine. Therefore, faster cutting speed can be obtained by increasing the laser power.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Laser fusion cutting is suitable for processing materials such as non-iron oxide metals and their alloys(e.g. stainless steel, stainless iron and titanium alloy).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_laser_oxygen_assisted_cutting">Laser oxygen-assisted cutting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike fusion cutting, oxygen-assisted cutting uses oxygen as an assist gas. The chemical reaction occurs between the oxygen and the metallic iron heated by the laser beam, releasing heat constantly to keep the heating and combustion of the metallic iron continuing. At the same time, the molten liquefied metal is blown away by the oxygen and the separation of the material is completed. The cut edge quality with this cutting method is less good than that of the fusion cutting. With thicker sheet material, the kerf gets wider, the cut edge gets rougher and heat-affected zone gets deeper.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In laser oxygen-assisted cutting, the three most important factors are laser power, cutting speed and oxygen pressure, which interact with each other and jointly affect the cutting quality.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_laser_vaporization_cutting">Laser vaporization cutting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In laser vaporization cutting, the material is instantaneously heated to a vaporized state by the laser. Therefore, a very high laser power is required and the permissible thickness of the sheet is limited. Typically, the sheet thickness should not exceed the diameter of the focused beam.</p>

<h2 id="_1_3_operating_mode_of_the_laser_device">1.3 Operating mode of the laser device</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In laser cutting, there are two operating modes: Pulse mode and continuous wave mode</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In continuous wave mode, the output power remains constant. In pulse mode, the output power is alternately on and off in cycles. In addition, the power of the continuous wave mode is concentrated and uninterrupted while the pulse mode power is distributed and thus significantly lower the thermal effect on the sheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, continuous mode is used for large contour cutting; pulsing mode is used for piercing, sharp corner and small contour cutting to avoid over-burn of the sheet material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Main working parameters of pulse mode include: peak power, frequency and duty cycle. In fact, the continuous wave mode is a special case of the pulse mode when the duty cycle is 100%.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frequency is the number of cycles per second, measured in Hz.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here, duty cycle is the ratio of the amount of time with output power to the total time in a given period. It’s expressed as a percentage value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>frequency = duty cycle =</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The higher the pulse duty cycle, the higher the average power will be. The laser operates in continuous wave mode when the duty cycle is 100%.</p>
